                                                  ABSTRACT 
This project focuses on building a predictive model for estimating house prices based on three primary factors: square feet area, location, and the number of bedrooms. Utilizing a cleaned dataset of Hyderabad properties, the project leverages machine learning techniques to train a regression model. The primary objective is to provide users with an intuitive interface where they can input the property details and receive an estimated price instantly.
The methodology involves preprocessing the dataset to ensure consistency, feature selection, and the application of regression algorithms for accurate predictions. A graphical user interface has been developed to enhance user interaction, allowing non-technical users to utilize the prediction tool effectively. This project serves as a foundation for further expansion by incorporating additional features and improving the prediction accuracy over time.
